## Overview
The Easy Prop 1 robot is designed to implement risk management parameters and execute trading logic based on specified conditions. It includes the following features:

- Risk management parameters: The robot allows you to set the maximum risk exposure per trade and per day as a percentage of the account balance.
- Account balance tracking: The initial account balance is obtained and the final account balance is printed when the robot is deactivated.
- Trade execution: The robot checks if the maximum risk exposure per trade and per day is exceeded before executing a trade. It deducts the trade cost from the account balance and keeps track of the number of trades executed today.
